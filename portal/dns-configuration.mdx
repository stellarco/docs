title: "🔧 How to Configure Your DNS for a Custom Domain"
description: "You can use your own domain (like updates.yourcompany.com) to host your public changelog on Stellar. To do that, you’ll need to add a DNS record with your domain provider (like GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Google Domains, etc).

Follow the steps below to connect your custom domain."

## 🧪 Step 1: Choose Your Subdomain

Decide which subdomain you want to use, like:

```
updates.yourcompany.com
status.yourcompany.com
changelog.yourcompany.com
```

You’ll set this when adding a custom domain in your Stellar dashboard.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Add a DNS Record

Log in to your domain provider and add a **CNAME** or **ALIAS** record for your subdomain.

### DNS record details:

- **Type:** `CNAME` (or `ALIAS` if your provider supports it)
- **Name / Host:** `updates` _(or whatever subdomain you chose)_
- **Value / Points to:** `stellar-dns.com`
- **TTL:** Default (usually "Automatic" or 3600 seconds)

> 📌 If you're using a root/apex domain like `yourcompany.com`, you'll need to use an **ALIAS** or **ANAME** record instead of CNAME (since CNAMEs can't be used at the root).

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Verify the Domain

Once the DNS record is added, return to the Stellar dashboard and we’ll automatically check for the correct setup.

DNS changes may take a few minutes to a few hours to propagate globally. If everything’s configured correctly, your domain will be verified and ready to use.

## ✅ Example Setup

| Setting   | Value             |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Type      | CNAME             |
| Name/Host | `updates`         |
| Value     | `stellar-dns.com` |
| TTL       | Automatic / 3600  |
