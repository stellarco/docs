# API Reference

The Stellar API is a REST API that gives you full access to your workspace data. Every action you can take in the web app, you can do via the API.

## Base URL

```
https://usestellar.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication

All requests require an API key passed as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl https://usestellar.com/api/v1/features \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key"
```

### Getting an API key

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys** in the Stellar dashboard
2. Click **Create New Key**
3. Name it (e.g., "CI Pipeline" or "Agent: Writer Bot")
4. Copy the key — it's shown once

Or via the CLI:

```bash
stellar keys create --name "My Integration"
```

## Request format

- Send JSON bodies with `Content-Type: application/json`
- All endpoints return JSON

## Response format

Successful responses:

```json
{
  "data": { ... }
}
```

List endpoints include pagination:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "total": 142,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 25
  }
}
```

## Errors

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "Feature not found"
  }
}
```

Standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created |
| `204` | Deleted (no content) |
| `400` | Bad request |

| `403` | Forbidden (insufficient permissions) |
| `404` | Not found |
| `422` | Validation error |

## Rate limiting

1,000 requests per minute per API key. The response includes rate limit headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 997
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1700000000
```
