## What are Views?

Views remember your preferences:
- **Filters** - Which features to show
- **Sort order** - How to arrange them
- **Visible properties** - Which columns to display
- **Layout** - Table or kanban format

## View Components

Each view saves these settings:

1. **Filters** - Status, priority, assignee, properties
2. **Sort** - Order by any field
3. **Layout** - Table or kanban
4. **Visible Properties** - Which data to show
5. **Group By** - Kanban column organization

<Info>
Views update automatically. When features match your criteria, they appear in the view immediately.
