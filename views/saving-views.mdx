## Personal vs Team Views

### Personal Views
- Only visible to you
- Unlimited creation
- Perfect for individual workflows
- No impact on other users

### Team Views  
- Visible to everyone
- Created by Admins and Makers
- Maintain team alignment
- Shared perspectives

<Info>
Contributors can use team views but cannot create them. They can create unlimited personal views.

## Common View Patterns

### Sprint Planning
- Filter: Status = Planned
- Sort: Priority descending
- Group by: Assignee

### Bug Tracking
- Filter: Type = Bug, Status ≠ Released
- Sort: Created date (oldest first)
- Visible: Priority, Customer impact

### Roadmap Review
- Filter: Target date = This quarter
- Sort: Status, then Priority
- Group by: Product area
