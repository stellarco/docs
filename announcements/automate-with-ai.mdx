<Note>
AI-powered announcements are coming soon and will be available on all plans.
</Note>

Never miss announcing a feature again. When features move to "Releasing" status, AI automatically drafts a polished announcement based on your feature details and customer insights.

## How It Works

### Automatic Trigger
When a feature enters **Releasing** status:
1. AI analyzes the feature and linked insights
2. Drafts a compelling announcement
3. Saves as draft for your review
4. Notifies you to review and publish

### AI-Generated Content
The announcement includes:
- Engaging title based on feature name
- Customer-focused benefits
- Key improvements and changes
- Quotes from linked insights
- Appropriate category assignment
