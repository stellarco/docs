## Best Practices

**Clear Titles** - Mark as "[Internal]" for clarity

**Rich Documentation** - Use full formatting since only team sees it

**Link Freely** - Reference internal tools and documents

**Archive Old Posts** - Keep list manageable

## Converting Posts

### Make Private Post Public
1. Edit the announcement
2. Toggle off **Private post**
3. Update and publish
4. Now visible to everyone

### Make Public Post Private
1. Edit the announcement
2. Toggle on **Private post**
3. Update
4. Removed from public view

<Warning>
Converting public to private doesn't remove it from users who already saw it. Plan visibility from the start.
</Warning>

## Team Communication

- Document feature decisions
- Share Sprint retrospectives
