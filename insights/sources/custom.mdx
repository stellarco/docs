## Adding Website URLs

Include URLs for sources to:
- Display recognizable favicons
- Quickly identify sources at a glance
- Link back to the original platform

Example URLs:
- `https://discord.com` for Discord community
- `https://reddit.com` for Reddit feedback
- `https://typeform.com` for survey responses

<Tip>
The favicon appears next to the source name throughout Stellar, making it easy to spot feedback from specific channels.

## Using Custom Sources

Once created, your custom sources:
- Appear in the source dropdown when creating insights
- Can be used in filters to view feedback by channel
- Show in reports to analyze channel effectiveness

## Managing Sources

In the Sources settings, you can:
- **Edit** source names or URLs
- **View usage** - See how many insights use each source
- **Delete** unused sources (insights keep the source name)

<Note>
Stellar includes common sources like Email, Slack, and Support by default. Custom sources supplement these with your unique channels.
</Note>

## Best Practices

**Be specific** - "Customer Calls" is better than "Phone"

**Stay consistent** - Use the same source name across your team

**Add URLs** - Makes sources instantly recognizable

**Review quarterly** - Remove unused sources to keep the list clean
