<Info>
Text selection is perfect for insights that mention multiple features. Link different parts to different features.

## Why Link Insights?

**Prioritize with confidence** - See how much customer feedback supports each feature

**Share context** - Developers see actual customer quotes, not just requirements

**Track impact** - After shipping, review the original feedback that drove the feature

## Managing Links

### View Linked Features
- Links appear in the insight's properties panel
- Click any link to jump to that feature

### Remove Links
- Click the **X** next to any feature link
- Or select linked text and click **Unlink**

## From the Feature Side

When viewing a feature:
- See all linked insights in the **Insights** tab
- View specific quotes if text selection was used
- Understand the full customer context

<Tip>
The more insights you link, the stronger your prioritization becomes. Make linking part of your insight triage workflow.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

**Link during triage** - As you review new insights, immediately link to relevant features

**Use text selection** - Highlight the most compelling quotes for maximum impact

**Create features as needed** - If no feature exists yet, create it right from the insight

**Review before building** - Always check linked insights before starting development
