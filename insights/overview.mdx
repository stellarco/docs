## What are Insights?

Insights are individual pieces of customer feedback - feature requests, bug reports, praise, or pain points. They help you understand what customers really need and make data-driven product decisions.

## Key Benefits

**Never lose feedback** - Every customer comment, request, or complaint gets captured and organized.

**Connect feedback to features** - Link specific parts of insights to features you're building.

**See patterns emerge** - Tags, sentiment, and filtering reveal what matters most to customers.

**Stay aligned** - Everyone on your team sees the same customer feedback in one place.

## How It Works

### 1. Capture Feedback
Collect insights from multiple sources:
- Manual entry by your team
- Email forwards
- Integrations (Intercom, HubSpot, Slack, and more)
- Chrome extension for quick capture
- API for custom sources

### 2. Triage & Organize
New insights land in your **Inbox** where you can:
- Add tags for categorization
- Set sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
- Link to customer records
- Connect to relevant features

### 3. Connect to Features
The magic happens when you link insights to features:
- Select specific text within an insight
- Link that exact quote to a feature
- Build a evidence-based case for what to build next

## Workflow States

Insights move through three states:

| State | Purpose | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Inbox** | New, unprocessed feedback | Review and categorize |
| **Reviewed** | Processed and tagged feedback | Reference when planning |
| **Archived** | Old or resolved feedback | Keep for historical context |

## Getting Started

1. **Create your first insight** - Start capturing customer feedback
2. **Set up categories** - Organize with tags that match your workflow  
3. **Configure sources** - Track where feedback originates
4. **Link to features** - Connect feedback to your roadmap

<Info>
Insights are designed to work seamlessly with Features. As you collect feedback, you'll naturally discover what to build next.
