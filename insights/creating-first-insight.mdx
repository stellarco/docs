## Adding Context

After creating your insight, add important context using the properties panel:

### Status
Change the insight's workflow state:
- **Inbox** - New feedback that needs review
- **Reviewed** - Processed and categorized
- **Archived** - Resolved or outdated

### Source
Track where feedback originated:
- Select from existing sources (Email, Slack, Support, etc.)
- Create custom sources for your workflow
- Helps identify your most valuable feedback channels

## Linking a Customer

Connect feedback to the person who provided it:

1. Click **Link customer** in the properties panel
2. Search for existing customers or create new ones
3. Add their name and email
4. Now all feedback from this customer is connected

<Info>
Linking customers helps you see patterns - which customers request similar features or face the same issues.

In the future we will add support for customer properties so you can evaluate insights based on things like which pricing plan a customer is on or how active of a user they are on your platform. Reach out to us if this is something you are interested in using.
