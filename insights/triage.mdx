Triage is your workflow for processing new insights, ensuring important feedback gets attention while keeping your inbox manageable.

## The Triage Workflow

### 1. Start with Inbox
Filter to show only **Inbox** insights - these need your attention:
- New insights from integrations
- Manually added feedback
- Unprocessed customer input

### 2. Process Each Insight
For each insight in your inbox:
- **Add tags** - Categorize by theme
- **Set sentiment** - Positive, neutral, or negative
- **Link customer** - Connect to the person who gave feedback
- **Link to features** - Connect relevant product areas
- **Add comments** - Note any context or next steps

### 3. Update Status
Move insights through the workflow:
- **Keep in Inbox** - Needs more information
- **Mark as Reviewed** - Processed and ready for reference (press `R` then `V`)
- **Archive** - Resolved or outdated (press `A` then `R`)

## Quick Triage Tips

**Batch similar insights** - Process all bug reports together

**Use keyboard shortcuts** - `J/K` to navigate, `R+V` to mark reviewed, `A+R` to archive

**Set a schedule** - Dedicate 30 minutes daily or weekly

**Filter strategically** - Start with negative sentiment in inbox

## Team Triage

Divide and conquer with your team:
- Assign team members to specific tags
- Route insights based on product area
- Share triage duties by day of week
