# CLI Quick Start

The Stellar CLI lets you manage tasks, views, and API keys from the terminal. It's also how AI agents interact with Stellar.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g stellar-cli
```

## Authenticate

```bash
stellar auth login
```

Enter your email and password, or paste an API key. Your credentials are stored locally.

## Check your identity

```bash
stellar auth me
```

```json
{
  "id": "usr_abc123",
  "name": "Alice Chen",
  "email": "alice@company.com",
  "role": "maker"
}
```

## Basic commands

### List your tasks

```bash
stellar tasks list
```

### Create a task

```bash
stellar tasks create --title "Add dark mode" --status "Planned"
```

### Get the next task assigned to you

```bash
stellar tasks next
```

This is the command agents use to pick up work. It returns the highest-priority unstarted task assigned to the current user.

### View your saved views

```bash
stellar views list
```

### Get workspace context (for agents)

```bash
stellar context --json
```

Returns a structured context pack with your workspace's features, statuses, properties, and recent activity. Designed for AI agent consumption.
