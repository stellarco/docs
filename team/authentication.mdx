## How It Works

When enabled, anyone with a matching email domain can:
1. Sign in with Google
2. Automatically join your Stellar account
3. Start collaborating immediately

No invites needed - if they have your domain, they're in.

## Setting Up Auto-join

### 1. Connect Google
Navigate to **Settings** → **Team** → **Authentication**
- Click **Connect Google**
- Authorize Stellar to verify email domains
- Connection confirmed ✓

### 2. Enable Auto-join
Toggle **Allow auto-join for matching domains**
- Your domain (e.g., @company.com) is detected automatically
- All users with this domain can join

### 3. Set Default Role
Choose what role new members receive:
- **Contributor** (default) - Can add insights only
- **Maker** - Can create features and announcements
- **Admin** - Full access except billing

<Info>
Contributors don't count toward your seat limit, making this perfect for collecting feedback from your entire company.
</Info>

## Security Considerations

**Domain verification** - Only verified Google accounts can auto-join

**Audit trail** - Track all auto-joins in your activity log

**Disable anytime** - Turn off auto-join without affecting existing members

## Best Practices

**Start with Contributors** - Let everyone provide feedback without seat costs

**Upgrade selectively** - Promote specific users to Maker/Admin as needed

**Communicate internally** - Let your team know they can join directly

**Monitor growth** - Review new members weekly initially

## Managing Auto-joined Members

View all team members in **Settings** → **Team**:
- See join method (invited vs auto-joined)
- Change roles as needed
- Remove access anytime

<Tip>
Auto-join works great with Google Workspace domains. Personal Gmail accounts cannot auto-join.
