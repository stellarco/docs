# Agent Integration Guide

Stellar treats AI agents as first-class team members. Agents can read context, pick up tasks, update statuses, write comments, and file insights — using the same API and CLI that humans use.

This isn't a bolt-on integration. Agents are built into Stellar's core model.

## The agent-first vision

Most product tools were built for humans clicking around a GUI. Stellar was built for a world where some of your best contributors aren't human.

An agent working in Stellar can:

- **Read the full workspace context** — what's being built, what's prioritized, what customers are saying
- **Pick up tasks** from its queue, just like a developer grabbing the next ticket
- **Update progress** by changing statuses and adding comments
- **File insights** from customer conversations, logs, or research
- **Create features** when it identifies something worth building

No special agent API. No separate "bot" interface. The same endpoints, the same permissions model.

## How it works

### 1. Authenticate

Create an API key for your agent under **Settings → API Keys**. The agent authenticates with this key via the CLI or API.

```bash
stellar auth login --key sk_live_agent_abc123
```

Or use the API directly:

```bash
curl https://usestellar.com/api/v1/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_agent_abc123"
```

### 2. Get context

Before doing anything, the agent should understand the workspace:

```bash
stellar context --json
```

This returns a structured context pack:

```json
{
  "workspace": "Acme Corp",
  "statuses": ["Backlog", "Planned", "In Progress", "Done"],
  "properties": [
    { "name": "Priority", "type": "select", "options": ["Low", "Medium", "High"] }
  ],
  "features": [
    {
      "id": "feat_001",
      "title": "Add dark mode",
      "status": "Planned",
      "assignee": "agent:writer-bot",
      "tags": ["frontend"]
    }
  ],
  "recent_activity": [...]
}
```

### 3. Pick up a task

```bash
stellar tasks next --json
```

Returns the highest-priority task assigned to the agent. If nothing's in the queue, it returns empty — the agent knows to wait.

### 4. Do the work

The agent does whatever the task requires — writing code, drafting copy, researching, analyzing data. Stellar doesn't care what happens between pickup and completion.

### 5. Report back

```bash
stellar tasks update feat_001 --status "Done"
```

Add a comment with details:

```bash
curl -X POST https://usestellar.com/api/v1/features/feat_001/comments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_agent_abc123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"body": "Done. Implemented dark mode with system preference detection. PR: #142"}'
```

## Agent identity

Agents appear in the team list, activity feeds, and comment threads with their name and avatar — just like human members. When an agent updates a task, the activity log says "Writer Bot moved this to Done" not "API updated status."

## Security

Agents use API keys with the same permission model as human roles. You control what an agent can do by assigning it a role:

- **Maker** — full task and insight management (most agents need this)
- **Contributor** — can file insights and comment but not manage features
