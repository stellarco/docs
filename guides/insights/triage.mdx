# Triage

Triage is a focused workflow for processing new insights. Instead of scrolling through a list, triage shows you one insight at a time and lets you act on it fast.

## How it works

1. Open **Insights → Triage** from the sidebar
2. You'll see the oldest unprocessed insight
3. For each insight, you can:
   - **Tag it** — add relevant tags
   - **Link it** — connect to an existing feature
   - **Create a feature** — if this is a new request, create the feature right from triage
   - **Archive it** — not useful, remove from your active list
   - **Skip it** — come back to it later
4. After your action, the next insight appears

## Triage with AI

Enable AI-assisted triage in settings. Stellar will pre-suggest tags and feature links based on the insight content and your existing data. You approve or adjust — it doesn't auto-commit.

## Staying on top of it

Make triage a daily habit. Five minutes a day keeps your insight backlog from becoming a graveyard of unread feedback.
