# Insight Sources

Insights can enter Stellar from multiple channels:

## Manual entry

Click **New Insight** from the insights page. Paste in a quote, add context, tag it, and link it to a feature.

## Chrome extension

Highlight text on any webpage — a support ticket, a tweet, a Slack message — and send it to Stellar as an insight with one click.

## Email forwarding

Forward customer emails to your workspace's unique email address. Stellar parses the content and creates an insight automatically.

## Integrations

Connect your existing tools:

- **Intercom** — conversations become insights
- **Help Scout** — support tickets flow in
- **Crisp** — chat messages captured
- **Typeform / Tally** — survey responses
- **Salesforce / HubSpot** — CRM feedback
- **Zapier** — connect anything else

## API

Create insights programmatically. See the [API reference](/api/insights/create).

## Custom sources

Define your own source labels (e.g., "Sales Call", "User Interview") to track where feedback originates even when you enter it manually.
