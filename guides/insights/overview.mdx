# Insights

Insights are pieces of product feedback — feature requests, bug reports, praise, complaints, questions. They come from customers, teammates, support tickets, sales calls, or anywhere people talk about your product.

Stellar gives you one place to collect all of it, tag it, and connect it to the features you're building.

## What an insight looks like

Each insight has:

- **Title** — a short summary
- **Description** — the full context (supports rich text)
- **Source** — where it came from (Intercom, email, manual, etc.)
- **Tags** — your taxonomy for categorizing feedback
- **Linked features** — connect insights to the features they relate to
- **Person** — the customer or user who gave the feedback
- **Company** — the organization they belong to

## Why insights matter

Without insights, you're guessing what to build. With them, you can:

- See how many customers are asking for the same thing
- Prioritize features based on real demand
- Close the loop by announcing what you shipped to the people who asked for it
