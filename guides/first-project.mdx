# First Project Setup

After signing up, you'll set up your workspace. Here's what to do first.

## 1. Name your workspace

Pick something your team will recognize — usually your company or product name.

## 2. Invite your team

Add teammates by email. Assign them roles:

- **Admin** — full access, manages billing and settings
- **Maker** — creates and manages features, insights, and announcements
- **Contributor** — adds insights and comments, can't change settings

You can always change roles later.

## 3. Set up your first view

Views are how you organize work. Start with a simple list view of all features, then customize from there. See [Views](/guides/views/overview) for details.

## 4. Create your portal

Your portal is a public changelog where you announce updates to users. Set it up under **Settings → Portal**. See [Portal](/guides/portal/overview).

## 5. Generate an API key

If you're planning to use the CLI or connect agents, generate an API key under **Settings → API Keys**. You'll need this for authentication.

```
Settings → API Keys → Create New Key
```

Keep this key safe. It has full access to your workspace.
