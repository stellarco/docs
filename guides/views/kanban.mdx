# Kanban

Kanban view displays features as cards in columns grouped by status.

## Using kanban

- **Drag features** between columns to change their status
- **Click a card** to open the feature detail
- **Reorder within columns** to set priority

## Column mapping

Each column maps to a status in your workflow. The columns appear left-to-right in the order you've defined your statuses.

## Filtering in kanban

All the same [filters](/guides/views/filters-and-sorting) apply. Filter by assignee to see just one person's board, or by tag to focus on a product area.

## When to use kanban vs. list

- **Kanban** works best when you care about workflow state — what's in progress, what's blocked, what's done
- **List** works best when you're scanning a large number of features or doing bulk operations
