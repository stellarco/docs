# Views

Views are saved configurations for how you see your features. They combine filters, sorting, and display modes so you don't have to set them up every time.

## Default views

Stellar gives you a few out of the box:

- **All Features** — everything, no filters
- **My Work** — features assigned to you
- **Active** — features with "In Progress" status

## Creating a view

1. Start from the features list
2. Apply filters, sorting, and grouping
3. Click **Save View**
4. Name it and choose whether it's personal or shared with the team

## View types

- **List** — compact rows, good for scanning
- **Kanban** — columns by status (see [Kanban](/guides/views/kanban))

## Team views vs. personal views

Personal views are yours alone. Team views show up in every member's sidebar. Admins and makers can create team views.

## Favorites

Star any view to pin it to the top of your sidebar for quick access.
