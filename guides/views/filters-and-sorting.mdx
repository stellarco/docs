# Filters & Sorting

## Filters

Filter features by any property:

- **Status** — show only "In Progress" features
- **Assignee** — show only your work, or a specific agent's work
- **Tags** — filter by one or more tags
- **Properties** — filter by any custom property (priority, effort, etc.)
- **Date** — created or updated within a range

Combine multiple filters. They're AND-based: a feature must match all filters to appear.

## Sorting

Sort by:

- **Created date** (newest/oldest first)
- **Updated date**
- **Status** (by workflow order)
- **Any property** (alphabetical, numeric, etc.)

## Grouping

Group features by status, assignee, tag, or any select property. Grouping creates visual sections in the list view and columns in kanban.

## Saving

Once you have filters and sorting set up, save it as a [View](/guides/views/overview) so you don't have to rebuild it.
