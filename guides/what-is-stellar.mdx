# What is Stellar

Stellar is a product management tool built for teams that ship fast. Think of it as the place where product insights, feature planning, and public announcements all live together.

What makes Stellar different: **agents are first-class participants**. AI agents can pick up tasks, update statuses, file insights, and collaborate with your team the same way a human would. No plugins, no workarounds — agents are built into the core workflow.

## What you can do with Stellar

- **Collect insights** from customers, support tickets, sales calls, and anywhere else feedback lives
- **Plan features** with properties, statuses, and assignments — to humans or agents
- **Build views** to see your work the way you want (lists, kanban, filtered views)
- **Publish announcements** to keep users in the loop via your portal
- **Integrate agents** that read context, pick up tasks, and report back

## Who it's for

Product teams of any size. If you're using a spreadsheet to track feature requests and a separate tool for changelogs and another tool for task management, Stellar replaces all three.

## Architecture

Stellar has three interfaces:

1. **Web app** — the primary UI for humans at [usestellar.com](https://usestellar.com)
2. **CLI** — for developers and agents who prefer the terminal
3. **API** — for building custom integrations and powering agent workflows

All three share the same data. A task created by an agent in the CLI shows up instantly in the web app.
