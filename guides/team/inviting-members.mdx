# Inviting Members

## Send an invitation

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email address
4. Choose their role (admin, maker, or contributor)
5. Click **Send Invite**

They'll get an email with a link to join your workspace.

## Pending invitations

Invitations that haven't been accepted show as "Pending" in the team list. You can resend or revoke them.

## Removing members

Admins can remove any member from **Settings → Team**. Their data (insights, comments) stays — only their access is revoked.
