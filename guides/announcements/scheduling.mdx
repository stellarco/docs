# Scheduling Announcements

Write your announcement now, publish it later.

## How to schedule

1. Create your announcement and finish writing
2. Instead of clicking **Publish**, click **Schedule**
3. Pick the date and time
4. Stellar publishes it automatically at that time

## Use cases

- **Launch day coordination** — write the announcement early, schedule it for launch
- **Regular cadence** — write a weekly digest every Friday, schedule for Monday morning
- **Timezone targeting** — schedule for when your users are most active

## Managing scheduled posts

Scheduled announcements show a clock icon in the list view. You can:

- Edit the content before it publishes
- Change the scheduled time
- Cancel the schedule (returns to draft)
