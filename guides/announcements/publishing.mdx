# Publishing Announcements

## Publish immediately

Click **Publish** on any draft announcement. It appears on your portal instantly.

## What happens when you publish

- The announcement goes live on your [Portal](/guides/portal/overview)
- It appears in your RSS feed
- Email subscribers get notified (if email subscriptions are enabled)
- The published date is set to now (or your custom date)

## Unpublishing

Click **Unpublish** to pull a published announcement back to draft. It disappears from the portal immediately. Useful for corrections or premature publishes.

## Private posts

Mark an announcement as private to keep it visible only to your team. Private posts don't appear on the portal but are useful for internal release notes.

## Cover images

Add a cover image to make your announcement stand out on the portal. Upload an image or paste a URL. Recommended size: 1200×630px.
