# Announcements

Announcements are public posts about what you've built, fixed, or changed. They live on your [Portal](/guides/portal/overview) — your public-facing changelog.

## Creating an announcement

Click **New Announcement** from the announcements page. Each announcement has:

- **Title** — what you shipped
- **Body** — rich text with full editor support (markdown, images, embeds, video)
- **Cover image** — optional header image
- **Status** — draft or published
- **Published date** — when it goes live (can be in the past or future)
- **Tags** — categorize by type (feature, fix, improvement)

## Draft vs. published

Announcements start as drafts. Only published announcements appear on your portal. You can unpublish at any time to pull something back to draft.

## Linking to features

Connect announcements to the features they describe. This closes the loop — you can trace from customer insight to feature to announcement.
