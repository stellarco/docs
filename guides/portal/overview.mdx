- Each announcement with title, body, cover image, date, and tags
- Email subscription form for users who want updates

## Setting up your portal

2. Add your product name and description
3. Upload a logo
4. Your portal is live at `yourworkspace.usestellar.com`

## RSS

Your portal automatically generates an RSS feed at `yourportal.usestellar.com/rss`. Users can subscribe in their feed reader.

## Email subscriptions

Users can enter their email on your portal to get notified when you publish new announcements. Manage subscribers in portal settings.
