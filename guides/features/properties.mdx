# Properties

Properties are custom fields on features. Use them to track effort, impact, priority, product area, or anything else your team needs.

## Built-in properties

Every feature comes with:

- **Status** — workflow state (see [Statuses](/guides/features/statuses))
- **Assignee** — who owns this feature
- **Tags** — categorization labels

## Custom properties

Create your own under **Settings → Properties**. Supported types:

- **Select** — single choice from a list (e.g., Priority: Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- **Multi-select** — multiple choices (e.g., Platform: iOS, Android, Web)
- **Text** — free-form text
- **Number** — numeric value (e.g., Effort: 1-10)
- **Date** — target dates, deadlines

## Using properties in views

Properties power your [Views](/guides/views/overview). Filter by `Priority = High`, sort by `Effort`, or group by `Product Area`. Properties turn your feature list into a structured database.
