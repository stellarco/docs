# Assignment

Every feature can be assigned to an owner — a human team member or an AI agent.

## Assigning to a person

Click the assignee field on any feature and pick a team member. They'll get a notification. One assignee per feature — keep ownership clear.

## Assigning to an agent

Agents show up in the assignee picker just like humans. When you assign a feature to an agent:

1. The agent receives the task via its next context pull or webhook
2. It reads the feature description, linked insights, and properties
3. It does the work and updates the status
4. It can add comments to report progress or ask for clarification

See [Agent Patterns](/agents/patterns) for details on how agent assignment works end-to-end.

## Reassignment

Change the assignee anytime. The activity feed tracks who was assigned and when. Reassigning from an agent to a human (or vice versa) works the same way.

## Unassigned features

Features without an assignee sit in your backlog. Use views to filter for unassigned work and distribute it during planning.
