# Features

Features are the units of work in Stellar. A feature can be a product feature, a task, a bug fix, or any piece of work your team needs to track.

## Creating a feature

Click **New Feature** or press `N` from the features list. Each feature has:

- **Title** — what you're building
- **Description** — rich text with full editor support (markdown, embeds, images)
- **Status** — where it is in your workflow (see [Statuses](/guides/features/statuses))
- **Properties** — custom fields like effort, impact, priority (see [Properties](/guides/features/properties))
- **Assignee** — who's doing the work (a human or an agent)
- **Tags** — categorization
- **Linked insights** — the customer feedback driving this feature

## Feature detail view

Click any feature to open its detail view. From here you can:

- Edit the description
- View and add comments
- See the activity log (who changed what, when)
- Manage linked insights
- Update status and properties

## Comments

Discuss features inline. @mention teammates to notify them. Comments support markdown.

## Activity feed

Every change to a feature is logged — status changes, assignee changes, property updates, comments. Full audit trail, no configuration needed.
