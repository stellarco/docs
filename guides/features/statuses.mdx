# Statuses

Statuses represent the stages of your workflow. Every feature has exactly one status at any time.

## Default statuses

Stellar starts you with:

- **Backlog** — ideas and requests, not yet planned
- **Planned** — committed to building
- **In Progress** — actively being worked on
- **Done** — shipped
- **Archived** — removed from active view

## Customizing statuses

Go to **Settings → Statuses** to rename, reorder, add, or remove statuses. Match them to how your team actually works.

Examples:
- `Backlog → Design → Development → QA → Shipped`
- `Ideas → Next Up → Doing → Review → Done`

## Status changes

When you change a feature's status, it's logged in the activity feed. If you use the kanban view, drag features between columns to change status.

## Agents and statuses

When an agent picks up a task, it can move the status to "In Progress" and later to "Done" — just like a human. Status transitions are the primary way to track agent work.
