## Where Markdown Works

Use markdown formatting in:
- **Insight content** - Capture formatted feedback
- **Feature descriptions** - Document requirements
- **Announcement content** - Create engaging updates
- **Comments** - Add formatted discussions

## Supported Formatting

### Headers

Create hierarchy with headers:

```markdown
# H1 - Main Title
## H2 - Section Header
```

**Output:**
# H1 - Main Title
## H2 - Section Header

<Note>
Use H1 sparingly - typically once per document. H2 headers work best for sections.
</Note>

### Text Styling

Format text for emphasis:

```markdown
**Bold text** for strong emphasis
*Italic text* for subtle emphasis
<u>Underlined text</u> for highlighting
~~Strikethrough~~ for deprecated content
```

**Output:**
- **Bold text** for strong emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- <u>Underlined text</u> for highlighting
- ~~Strikethrough~~ for deprecated content

### Links

Create clickable links:

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

**Output:** [Link text](https://example.com)

## Lists

### Bullet Lists

Create unordered lists:

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item
```

**Output:**
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

### Numbered Lists

Create ordered lists:

```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

**Output:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Todo Lists

Track tasks with checkboxes:

```markdown
- [ ] Uncompleted task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Another todo
```

**Output:**
- [ ] Uncompleted task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Another todo

## Advanced Tips

**Combine Formatting** - Mix styles for clarity:
```markdown
**Important:** This is a *critical* update with ~~deprecated~~ features
```

**Nested Lists** - Organize complex information:
```markdown
- Main feature
  - Sub-feature 1
    - Detail A
    - Detail B
  - Sub-feature 2
```

**Clean URLs** - Make links readable:
```markdown
Check our [documentation](https://docs.example.com) for details
```

## Common Patterns

### Feature Requirements

## User Story
As a **user**, I want to *filter features* so that I can find what I need.
