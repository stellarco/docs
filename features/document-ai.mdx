## What is Document AI?

Document AI analyzes your feature and its connected insights to generate:
- **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**
- **Technical Specifications**
- **User Stories**
- **Release Notes**
- **API Documentation**
- **Migration Guides**

All generated from the context you've already built in Stellar.

## How It Works

### 1. Build Context
The more information connected to your feature, the better:
- Feature description
- Linked customer insights
- Properties and metadata
- Comments and discussions

### 2. Choose Document Type
Select what you need:
- PRD - Comprehensive requirements
- Tech Spec - Implementation details
- User Stories - Agile format
- Custom Templates - Your formats

### 3. Generate and Refine
AI creates a first draft:
- Review generated content
- Edit as needed
- Regenerate sections
- Export or share
