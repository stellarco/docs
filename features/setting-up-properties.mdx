## Best Practices

**Start simple** - Add 3-5 essential properties first

**Use consistent values** - "High/Medium/Low" not "High/Med/L"

**Document meanings** - Share definitions with your team

**Review quarterly** - Remove unused properties to reduce clutter

**Consider automation** - Use properties that can be updated programmatically via API

<Tip>
Great properties make filtering and reporting powerful. Think about what questions you need to answer about your features.
