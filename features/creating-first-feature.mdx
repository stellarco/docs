## Best Practices

**Start lean** - Create features with just a title, add details as you learn more

**Link early** - Connect insights as soon as you create features

**Update status** - Keep status current so your team knows what's happening

**Review regularly** - Check linked insights before starting development

## What's Next?

- [Set up custom properties](/features/setting-up-properties) for your workflow
