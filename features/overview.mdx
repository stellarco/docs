Features are your product roadmap items - the things you're planning to build. Connect them to customer feedback to make confident prioritization decisions.

## What are Features?

Features represent product capabilities you're considering, planning, or building:
- New functionality to add
- Improvements to existing features  
- Bug fixes and technical debt
- Any work that impacts your product

## The Features Workflow

### 1. Create Features
Add features as you identify potential product work:
- From customer insights
- During planning sessions
- From internal ideas
- When bugs are reported

### 2. Connect Customer Evidence
Link insights to features to build your case:
- See how many customers want each feature
- Read actual customer quotes
- Understand use cases and context
- Quantify demand

### 3. Organize and Prioritize
Use properties and views to manage your roadmap:
- Set priority levels
- Assign to team members
- Track status through development
- Group by themes or releases

| **Discovery** | Researching feasibility and requirements |
| **Backlog** | Approved but not yet scheduled |
| **Planned** | Committed to roadmap with timeline |
| **Delivery** | Actively being built |
| **Beta** | Testing with limited users |
| **Releasing** | Rolling out to all users |
| **Released** | Fully shipped and available |
